# Railway Track Surveillance System

## Overview
The **Railway Track Surveillance System** is a deep learning-based project designed to detect and monitor objects along railway tracks, primarily focusing on identifying obstacles or threats. This system utilizes the YOLOv4 model for real-time object detection and ensures a safer environment for train operations.

The project provides a comprehensive solution, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment of the surveillance system for monitoring railway tracks.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv4 model to detect various objects along the railway track.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Identifies obstacles like rocks, trees, or other items that may obstruct the track.
- **Safety Monitoring**: Tracks and reports any potential threats, providing notifications to authorities.
- **Image and Video Analysis**: Processes both images and videos for continuous surveillance.
